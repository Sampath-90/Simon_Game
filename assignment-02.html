          <ul>
            <li>Click the START button to begin. The game will begin 3 seconds after the light turns green.</li>
            <li>Simon will give the first signal (randomly flash a coloured	button). Repeat the signal by clicking
              the	same colour button.
            </li>
            <li>Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by clicking the same
              colour buttons, in order.
            </li>
            <li>Simon will duplicate these two signals and add one. Continue playing as long as you repeat each 
              sequence of signals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically
              speeds up the interval between the signals.
            </li>
            <li>If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal,
              Simon responds by flashing all four buttons simultaneously five times. This means you have lost and the 
              sequence of signals ends. The game status indicator will turn back to red colour and you will have to 
              click START button again to start a new game. The all-time high score is displayed to the left of the 
              START button.
            </li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
